Note on reading the output data of Vroni:

Four dummy points are added in the exterior of the bounding box of input sites prior
computation of the Voronoi diagram. Hence when scanning the Voronoi diagram, it is
prudent to check whether both defining sites belong to the initial input.

isFrontier (boolean)
  - isfrontier (boolean) - is either of the neighbouring sites a frontier?



"Map segmentation" (actually it is a graph segmentation)
========================================================

Goal of graph segmentation is to find "critical nodes". Critical nodes are such nodes
of the graph that divide
