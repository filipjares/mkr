CRITICAL NODE DEFINITION
========================

- should the critical node really have strictly minimal clearance radius
  compared to its neighbours?
- how to define what does it mean that critical nodes "lead from known to unknown areas"?


TESTS to write
==============

VRONI's representation of nodes of degree higher than 3
-------------------------------------------------------

- does exist node having only single edge?
- does exist node having multiple 


OTHER THINGS TO CHECK, DISCUSS AND IMPROVE
==========================================

- Is it possible to search for the root node in a more efficient and correct way?
- frontiers in input segments for Vroni, frontier flag in Polygon segments:
  different definition of segment being frontier in "outer" segments and "holes"?
  Note by Tomáš: this is almost certainly misleading idea from me :) I'll check it.
- (create a class to store all the poly2vd's output data in it (a good choice would be the
  winged edge data structure); add method returning objects of this class to Poly2VdConverter's
  interface)
- All the functions in VroniUtils.hpp are static. This means, I suppose, that there are as many
  instances as there are modules (*.cpp files) that include VroniUtils.hpp. Is there some
  better solution?


TODO
====

- use euclidean lengths and when setting "pointers" to previous nodes, store the shortest path
- create synthetic map similar to that in util/fiddling_with_vroni/data/map_from_the_paper.dxf
  with more realistic passages 
- create world map for the Stage with larger rooms in order to obtain larger unexplored areas
- improve root node search
- along with input segments and points, publish their ids as text markers (for debugging
  purposes)
- along with output (WMAT) edges, publish their (both left and right) source sites' types and
  ids (for debugging purposes)
- create some (user) interface enabling to set up Poly2VdConverter's internal parameters
  "online"
	- use rosparam
	- Parameters that could be tuned:
		- COMPARISON_RATIO (currently defined in VroniUtils.hpp)
		- switch the "experimental node markup" on/off (i.e. determine whether
		  experimentallyMarkTheNode() should be called)
- update READMEs
- critical nodes are being looked for during the "backtracking phase", implement removal of
  critical nodes being closer to the root than the newly found critical node into the
  backtracking phase

FIXED ISSUES
============

- Issue: It seems that VD data and input data do not fit exactly.  VD edges seem to hang over
  input segments.

  Hypothesis: Is it possible that listener is providing different polygons to ROS (for
  visualization) and different polygons as input for Vroni?

  Answer: YES it was the case. The reason was that the CM macro, used in listener.cpp to
  convert centimeters to meters, was defined as an integer. Therefore undesirable rounding
  occured.


QUESTIONS TO ASK (C/C++ related)
================================

- What is the difference between primitive public static const member and non-primitive public
  static const member? Why do I have to define Color constants outside the Color class
  body? It is possible do define VdPublisher::RVIZ_EDGES_WIDTH inside the VdPublisher
  class body...
