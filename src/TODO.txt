CRITICAL NODE DEFINITION
========================

- should the critical node really have strictly minimal clearance radius
  compared to its neighbours?


TESTS to write
==============

VRONI's representation of nodes of degree higher than 3
-------------------------------------------------------

- does exist node having only single edge?
- does exist node having multiple 


OTHER THINGS TO CHECK DISCUSS AND IMPROVE
=========================================

- Is it possible to search for the root node in a more efficient way?

# this is almost certainly misleading idea from me :) I'll check it.
- frontiers in input segments for Vroni, frontier flag in Polygon segments:
  different definition of segment being frontier in "outer" segments and "holes"?
- Shift exists between base_laser_link coordinate frame and base_link frames.
  Is it taken into account? It seems that VD data and input data do not fit exactly.
  VD edges seem to hang over input segments.
- Is it possible that listener is providing different polygons to ROS (for visualization) and
  different polygons as input for Vroni?


TODO
====

- use euclidean lengths and when setting "pointers" to previous nodes, store the shortest path
- create synthetic map similar to that in util/fiddling_with_vroni/data/map_from_the_paper.dxf
  with more realistic passages 
- create world map for the Stage with larger rooms in order to obtain larger unexplored areas
- remove dependency of poly2vd on SPosition type defined in types.h
