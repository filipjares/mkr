CRITICAL NODE DEFINITION
========================

- should the critical node really have strictly minimal clearance radius
  compared to its neighbours?


TESTS to write
==============

VRONI's representation of nodes of degree higher than 3
-------------------------------------------------------

- does exist node having only single edge?
- does exist node having multiple 


OTHER THINGS TO CHECK DISCUSS AND IMPROVE
=========================================

- frontiers in input segments for Vroni, frontier flag in Polygon segments:
  different definition of segment being frontier in "outer" segments and "holes"?


TODO
====

- create synthetic map similar to that in util/fiddling_with_vroni/data/map_from_the_paper.dxf
  with more realistic passages
